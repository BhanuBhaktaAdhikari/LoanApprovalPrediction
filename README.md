# LoanApprovalPrediction

When determining the eligibility of an applicant for a loan, financial institutions must consider various factors. Machine learning finds common application in predicting loan approval within the financial industry. In the development of a machine learning model for loan approval prediction, I have adhered to the following steps:

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Gather historical loan data, encompassing both approved and denied loans.
Perform data cleaning and preprocessing by addressing missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis:

Conduct a comprehensive examination of the dataset, including the number of rows, columns, data types, and identification of missing values.
Visualize the distribution of the target variable (loan approval or denial) using bar plots or pie charts.
Explore the distribution of individual features, both numerical and categorical, utilizing histograms, box plots, or bar charts.
Identify and handle outliers through the use of box plots.

3. Data Splitting:

Divide the dataset into training and testing sets to facilitate effective model evaluation.

4. Model Selection:

Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm for the binary classification problem, considering options such as Logistic Regression, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and XGBoost.

5. Model Training:

Train the selected model using the designated training dataset.

6. Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance using relevant metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Take into account the specific requirements and constraints of the application when interpreting and validating the model's effectiveness.

The project attains an accuracy of approximately 0.80 employing a logistic regression model. Additional enhancements can be explored through feature engineering and experimenting with alternative algorithms.
